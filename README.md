- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in eventually becoming a full-stack web developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything I can get my hands on, but my main focuses are anything to do with front-end development and some full-stack.  I've spent many months learning ReactJS and implementing various things in it.  I'm specifically on a journey to complete as many Frontend Mentor challenges as I can as fast as I can, using React, JS/TS, and Tailwind.  
- I'm planning on building a portfolio website ASAP which will showcase my skills.
